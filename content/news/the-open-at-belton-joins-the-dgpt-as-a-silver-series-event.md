The Open, presented by Discraft, pro purse surpassed $17,000 for the first time since the events' founding in 2015.</span>

**B**ack in March, when covid hit hard and everything seemed to change overnight, The Open at Belton was the next big event coming up for many of the touring pros, most of whom were already in Texas. The previous weekend was the Waco Charity Open. When that was cut short The Open tournament directors, Neal Dambra and Jim Hudson, knew they were about to be next on the chopping block. At least that's what it felt like. Even though the inevitable was at hand the work went on. The OB was getting marked, porta potties were delivered, finals sponsors were being added to the caddie guide, scorecards were being printed and the unusually high volume of players questions were being answered as quickly as possible. It was four days of non-stop scramble and it was almost a relief when Texas state and the PDGA finally pulled the trigger and cancelled all upcoming events. Deep breath. What next?

<br/>

Not wanting to skip a 2020 version of The Open at Belton presented by Discraft was quickly added back into the PDGA A-Tier schedule for a late November date. The rescheduled date may have turned out to be a blessing in disguise (and what a disguise it was!) when, after a very successful event, The Open was picked up on Disc Golf Pro Tour's radar during their final scheduling sessions. After a couple of "get to know you" virtual meetings with the DGPT and consultation with the Belton Parks department, TOaB and DGPT agreed the tournament would be one of six 2021 Silver Series events nationwide. Needless to say, TOaB staff and the city of Belton are very pleased to be part of the DGPT in 2021.

<br/>

"Our goal always has been, from the start, to elevate this particular stage for professional disc golfers" said Hudson. "Partnering with the DGPT definitely helps us do that, especially in the areas of marketing and media exposure. We expect it will all translate into our biggest pro payout to date."

<br/>

"Since the course will only be used for pros this year, we will be tightening up the OB on a few holes and hoping to add a new Turtle Back style green to hole five" added Dambra. One thing is for sure, the competitors can expect another challenging trek along with the extra pressure, glamor and exposure provided by the DGPT. TD's Hudson and Dambra were quick to add a score of 50 has yet to be broken on the long layout of The Open Course at Heritage Park in MPO competition. Texans [Connor O'Reilly](https://www.pdga.com/player/99648) and [Tanner Girouard](https://www.pdga.com/player/88077) hold the mark at 51 set this past November. [Catrina Allen](https://www.pdga.com/player/44184) , with a spectacular 1025 rated 56 in 2019, holds the women's mark by far. A bonus prize will be awarded in 2021 to any 49 by an MPO or a 55 for FPO.

<br/>

No matter what, The Open at Belton 2021 should prove to be another step forward in raising public awareness in central Texas of professional disc golf. We all respect November, the preference, for many reasons, is that it happens in March this time around.

<br/>

The tournament will take place March 19-21 at Heritage Park with professionals playing all three days and amateurs playing Saturday and Sunday only. A new course will be introduced for the AMs. More details to follow. Registration for all players will be available on Jan 1. Age-protected divisional players may register early by becoming a Journeyman Sponsor.
