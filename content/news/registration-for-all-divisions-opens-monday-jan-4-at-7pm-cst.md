The DGPT Tour Pass program has just completed and over the past three weeks dozens of touring players opted for the Tour Pass. The pass allows them to choose Elite and Silver Series events individually or choose from tour packages. The packages include entry to all Elite and Silver Series DGPT events.

<br/>

The Open at Belton attracted 31 Tour Pass players including former event champion disc golfers of the year, [James Conrad](https://www.pdga.com/player/17295) (2018) and [Ezra Aderhold](https://www.pdga.com/player/121715) (2020). Joining them will be many other top rated Tour Pass players, most notably, current PDGA World Champions [Paige Pierce](https://www.pdga.com/player/29190) and [Paul McBeth](https://www.pdga.com/player/27523), both with Team Discraft.

<br/>

“As you can imagine we are super excited to host these great players in March. We are working closely with Belton Parks to make sure the course is in top condition for the competitors, fans and the media.” said Jim Hudson, one of the tournament directors.

<br/>

“A number of touring players like McBeth, Conrad and Pierce have never played the course – but I’m sure they will be ready by their first round tee time on Friday.” According to the directors there will be a few changes compared to the 2020 set up with a bit of OB added, more clearing on hole 13, some infrastructure improvements and a new raised green added to hole 5.

<br/>

DGPT tiered registration opens on January 4 at 7pm along with all other divisions including age-protected Pros, all Ams and Juniors. You can register or read more about the event [here.](https://www.discgolfscene.com/tournaments/The_Open_at_Belton_2021/register)
