  The Open Course at Heritage Park will be in its DGPT Silver Series setup which
  means marked Out of Bounds (OB) will be added to a number of holes and a few
  baskets may be elevated. We will update the caddie guide here as we develop
  the final set-up. We expect all to be finalized by March 8. If you have any
  questions contact theopendgc@nealdambra.com.
