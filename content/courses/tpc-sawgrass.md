  From the initial idea by former PGA TOUR Commissioner Deane R. Beman, the
  Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass was built in 1982 to host THE PLAYERS
  Championship and be the permanent Home of THE PLAYERS Championship. As the
  first true “Stadium Course,” it was designed to improve the overall on-site
  fan experience. Finally, the Stadium Course would be a championship-caliber
  course accessible to all golf fans.
